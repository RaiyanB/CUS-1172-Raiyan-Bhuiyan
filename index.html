        <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I am currently in my senior year pursuing a bachelor's degree in Information Technology with a minor in Business Administration. I plan to continue into an MBA program. Before attending St. John's University, I studied at Thomas A. Edison Career & Technical Education High School in Queens, NY, where I specialized in Information Technology and Cisco Networking for three years. I graduated with more than four technical certifications and completed an internship with Cisco, as well as a part-time position with the NYC Department of Education for IT-related operations. Additionally, I attended the FEP U. Porto Economics and Management program.</p>
